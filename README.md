# StoryLinkðŸ”¥

Discover a new way to share and explore stories with StoryLink, the ultimate blog app designed to foster connections through the art of storytelling. Whether you're an avid writer, a passionate reader, or both, StoryLink provides a platform where your words can resonate, inspire, and connect with a diverse global community.

### Features

**Blogging Platform:** StoryLink allows users to create and publish technical blog posts. The platform is designed to make writing and sharing articles easy, with a user-friendly editor and markdown support.

**Developer Community:** StoryLink brings together developers, programmers, and tech enthusiasts to discuss various topics related to programming, software development, technology trends, and more.

**User Profiles:** Each user has a profile where they can showcase their articles, interactions, and expertise. This helps build a personal brand within the developer community.

**User Authentication:**

1. **Secure Sign-Up Process:** Implement a robust sign-up process that collects essential user information and verifies the provided email address.

2. **Secure Password Storage:** Hash and salt passwords using strong cryptographic algorithms to ensure that plain text passwords are never stored in the database.

3. **Login Page Protection:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks on the login page.

4. **Session Management:** Use secure session management techniques to handle user sessions, including setting session timeouts and utilizing secure cookies.

**User Authorization:**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to define different user roles (admin, user, moderator, etc.) with varying levels of access to application features.

2. **Resource-Based Authorization:** Use resource-based access control to specify which resources (such as pages or API endpoints) a user with a particular role can access.

3. **Permission System:** Implement a permission system that assigns specific permissions to roles and users to control their actions within the application.

4. **Dynamic Authorization:** Allow for dynamic changes to user permissions based on specific conditions or user actions.

**Password Reset:**

1. **Forgot Password Flow:** Provide a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their password if they forget it.

2. **Secure Password Reset Tokens:** Generate unique, time-limited tokens for password reset links to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Email Notifications:** Send an email with a password reset link to the user's registered email address when a reset request is initiated.

4. **Token Expiry:** Set a short expiration time for password reset tokens to limit their usability and enhance security.

5. **User Verification:** Before allowing a password reset, verify the user's identity through a secondary factor like email or security questions.

6. **Password Complexity:** Encourage users to choose strong passwords during the reset process and provide guidelines for password complexity.

**Rate Limiting:**

1. **API Protection:** Implement rate limiting on your APIs to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of server resources.

2. **IP-Based Limits:** Implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent a single IP address from making an excessive number of requests within a specified time period.

3. **Token-Based Limits:** For authenticated requests, consider applying rate limits based on the authentication token or user session to better control usage.

4. **Graceful Handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages when rate limits are exceeded, making it clear to users or applications that they need to slow down their requests.

5. **Exponential Backoff:** If a request is denied due to rate limits, instruct clients to implement exponential backoff before making additional requests to avoid overloading the server.

6. **Dynamic Rate Limiting:** Consider dynamically adjusting rate limits based on server load or traffic spikes to ensure smooth operation during peak times.

### Upcoming Releases

1. **Account Locking:** Implement mechanisms to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality, such as limiting the number of reset attempts within a certain time frame.
2. **Email Verification:** Send a verification link to the user's email to confirm their identity and activate their account.
3. **Audit Trails:** Log user access and authorization actions to maintain a record of who accessed what resources and when.

4. **Tags and Categories:** Authors can categorize their blog posts using tags and categories, making it easier for readers to find content relevant to their interests.

5. **OAuth and Social Authentication:** Allow users to log in using their existing accounts on platforms like Google, Facebook, or GitHub, using OAuth or similar protocols.
